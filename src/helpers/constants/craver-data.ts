    <tutorial>
    Create a New Modifier
    Click on the “add new modifier” button. Add a name for your customization. If you want the name that appears in the app to be different, you can add a title as well. Otherwise, you can leave it blank. 
    You can add numbers to minimum and maximum selectable options if you’d like to force or limit how many options are selected by the users. 
    You can also select if the customization is mandatory (required) or optional.  
    Add Options to the Modifier
    Now that the new customization is created, you need to add some options to it. 

    Click on the ⋮ icon beside the customization and select “options”.

    Click the “Add New Option” Button. 

    Enter a name and a price add-on for the option if applicable. 

    Do this for every option separately until all options have been added.

    Add the Modifier to Products
    Find the product that you are looking for in the full menu view under products. Click the ⋮ beside the product and select edit. 

    Scroll down and under items click on the ↕ icon beside the item. Now you should be seeing the customizations (if any) that are attached to this item. 

    Click on “add customization” and select all the customizations that apply then click add. 

    Make sure that you do this for all the item variations listed in the product if applicable.

    How to Set Up Your Reward Tiers
    </desc>
    <tutorial>
    This video shows you how to create your rewards tiers in the admin panel so that your customers can redeem their points for free items or dollar discounts. 

    We will take care of doing the initial setup of your loyalty rewards program in the app but you are able to create your own rewards tiers in the app using the admin panel. 

    You can offer your customers points based on the dollar amount of their orders or per order. For example, you can offer 1 point for every $1 spent or 1 point for every order. The default setup in the app is 1 point for every $1 unless you ask us to change that for you. 

    Your customers will be able to redeem their points for either free items from the menu or dollar discounts. In order for customers to be able to redeem their points, you’d need to create rewards tiers in the app. 

    To create your rewards tiers, go to the rewards tab in the admin panel and click the “Add New Tier” button. Enter the points for the rewards tier, give it a name and add a description so that your customers know what they can get in exchange for their points. You can also add an image for your rewards tier.

    Under Rewards Type, you can select Item or Dollar.

    1. When you select Dollar, you’d have to enter the dollar amount in the box next to it. Click “Apply Changes” after you are done and proceed with creating all your rewards tiers. 

    2. If you choose to offer free Items with points, you’d need to assign the items that you’d like to offer for free with points to the rewards tiers that you have created. To do this, you can select items under the “Attached Items” field when you are creating or editing a rewards tier. You can search for products by their name or category name or you can just click the dropdown and select products.

    How to Create Coupons & Add Restrictions
    </desc>
    <tutorial>
    Creating a Coupon
    Go to the coupons tab in the admin panel and click the “Add New Coupon” button. 

    Your coupon needs to have a code and title. You can add a description (optional) as well.

    Under Exclusive, when you select ‘yes’, the coupon cannot be combined with other coupons in the same order. If ‘no’ is selected, this restriction does not apply.

    Under Auto Apply, if ‘yes’ is selected, the discount will automatically apply at checkout but if ‘no’ is selected, the users needs to enter the coupon code in the checkout page for the discount to apply. Make sure to share the coupon code with your customers if you go with this option.

    Select an Action Type of Dollar or Percent and enter an Action Value next to it. For example, for a 10% off coupon, Action Type needs to be Percent and Action Value needs to be 10.

    Adding Restrictions
    When you create a coupon, you may want to add some restrictions to it to limit the instances that the discount can be used. For example, you can limit the dates that coupon can be used or limit the number of times a user can use the coupon. 

    To add restrictions to a coupon, click the ⋮ icon beside the coupon and select ‘Restrictions’. Then click the “Add New Restriction” button and select the restriction you want to add under Type and add a select or add a value if applicable. 

    You can add as many restrictions as you want to a coupon. The video explains what each restriction is for.

    </desc>
    <tutorial>
    From the locations tab, you can select the particular location you would like to mark as closed and toggle the on/off button for the day as required. Once the location hours are turned off for a day, customers would be unable to place orders through the app until it is turned back on.

    It is important to note that once your restaurant is ready to begin receiving orders and location is toggled on, you MUST set the hours restaurant is to be opened for before applying changes.

    How To Setup Holiday Hours
    </desc>
    <tutorial>
    The admin panel is also equipped with a smart feature for enabling custom holiday hours. The set holidays can also be custom fitted within a specific time window up to 24 hours. Setting up holiday hours is recommended if your location is to be closed at a known future date. This automatically indicates your location closed and disallows orders from being placed within the allotted time period in holiday.
