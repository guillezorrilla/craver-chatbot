    <tutorial>
    Create a New Modifier
    Click on the “add new modifier” button. Add a name for your customization. If you want the name that appears in the app to be different, you can add a title as well. Otherwise, you can leave it blank. 
    You can add numbers to minimum and maximum selectable options if you’d like to force or limit how many options are selected by the users. 
    You can also select if the customization is mandatory (required) or optional.  
    Add Options to the Modifier
    Now that the new customization is created, you need to add some options to it. 

    Click on the ⋮ icon beside the customization and select “options”.

    Click the “Add New Option” Button. 

    Enter a name and a price add-on for the option if applicable. 

    Do this for every option separately until all options have been added.

    Add the Modifier to Products
    Find the product that you are looking for in the full menu view under products. Click the ⋮ beside the product and select edit. 

    Scroll down and under items click on the ↕ icon beside the item. Now you should be seeing the customizations (if any) that are attached to this item. 

    Click on “add customization” and select all the customizations that apply then click add. 

    Make sure that you do this for all the item variations listed in the product if applicable.

    How to Set Up Your Reward Tiers
    </desc>
    <tutorial>
    This video shows you how to create your rewards tiers in the admin panel so that your customers can redeem their points for free items or dollar discounts. 

    We will take care of doing the initial setup of your loyalty rewards program in the app but you are able to create your own rewards tiers in the app using the admin panel. 

    You can offer your customers points based on the dollar amount of their orders or per order. For example, you can offer 1 point for every $1 spent or 1 point for every order. The default setup in the app is 1 point for every $1 unless you ask us to change that for you. 

    Your customers will be able to redeem their points for either free items from the menu or dollar discounts. In order for customers to be able to redeem their points, you’d need to create rewards tiers in the app. 

    To create your rewards tiers, go to the rewards tab in the admin panel and click the “Add New Tier” button. Enter the points for the rewards tier, give it a name and add a description so that your customers know what they can get in exchange for their points. You can also add an image for your rewards tier.

    Under Rewards Type, you can select Item or Dollar.

    1. When you select Dollar, you’d have to enter the dollar amount in the box next to it. Click “Apply Changes” after you are done and proceed with creating all your rewards tiers. 

    2. If you choose to offer free Items with points, you’d need to assign the items that you’d like to offer for free with points to the rewards tiers that you have created. To do this, you can select items under the “Attached Items” field when you are creating or editing a rewards tier. You can search for products by their name or category name or you can just click the dropdown and select products.

    How to Create Coupons & Add Restrictions
    </desc>
    <tutorial>
    Creating a Coupon
    Go to the coupons tab in the admin panel and click the “Add New Coupon” button. 

    Your coupon needs to have a code and title. You can add a description (optional) as well.

    Under Exclusive, when you select ‘yes’, the coupon cannot be combined with other coupons in the same order. If ‘no’ is selected, this restriction does not apply.

    Under Auto Apply, if ‘yes’ is selected, the discount will automatically apply at checkout but if ‘no’ is selected, the users needs to enter the coupon code in the checkout page for the discount to apply. Make sure to share the coupon code with your customers if you go with this option.

    Select an Action Type of Dollar or Percent and enter an Action Value next to it. For example, for a 10% off coupon, Action Type needs to be Percent and Action Value needs to be 10.

    Adding Restrictions
    When you create a coupon, you may want to add some restrictions to it to limit the instances that the discount can be used. For example, you can limit the dates that coupon can be used or limit the number of times a user can use the coupon. 

    To add restrictions to a coupon, click the ⋮ icon beside the coupon and select ‘Restrictions’. Then click the “Add New Restriction” button and select the restriction you want to add under Type and add a select or add a value if applicable. 

    You can add as many restrictions as you want to a coupon. The video explains what each restriction is for.

    How to Mark Products, Product Variations & Modifier Options as Out of Stock
    </desc>
    <tutorial>
    Product Out of Stock
    To mark a product as out of stock, go to the full menu view in the menu tab of the admin panel and search for the product by name. Click on the ⋮ icon beside the product and select edit. In the edit mode, locate the “Out of Stock” field and select the location that is out of this product. Click apply changes when you are done. 

 
    Product Variation Out of Stock
    Some of your products may come in different variations and you can choose to mark only one variation as out of stock. To do this repeat the steps above to go to the edit product page. Under “Items” select the variation that you’d like to mark as out of stock and click on the ↕ button beside it to expand the options. Locate the “Out of Stock Locations” field and select the location that is out of stock. Click the apply changes button when you are done.

 
    Customization (Modifier) Option Out of Stock
    You can also mark any of your customization (modifier) options as out of stock. To do this, go to the customizations section under the menu tab and locate the customization. Click the ⋮ button beside it, select “Options” and this will take you to a page where you can see and edit all the options under that customization group. Click on the ⋮ button beside any option that you’d like to mark as out of stock and select edit. You can select the location that is out stock in the “Out of Stock” field. Click apply changes when you are done. You may have more than one customization group with this option and in this case, you’d have to mark the option as out of stock under each customization group separately. 

 
    * Please note that the out of stock feature is a manual feature and it has to be turned on and off in the admin panel. This will not reset automatically.

    How to Prepare Your Excel File for a Menu Import
    </desc>
    <tutorial>
    Your Craver account manager will provide you with a template that you can work with to create your menu. 

    If you are using one of the POS providers that Craver is integrated with, your menu will be imported from your POS by our team. If Craver is not integrated with your POS, you can use the excel file to prepare your menu and upload it into the app. 

    The excel file needs to be created in a specific format that the video will explain. If the file is not in the proper format, the import will not be done successfully. You’ll also need to ensure that all fields in the excel file are properly filled so that the menu can be uploaded properly into the app. 

    Please note that with every new import, the previous menu will be over-written in the app and you won’t be able to undo that action. You may wish to export your current menu first to make sure you have a copy of it in case something goes wrong with the import.

    Deleting Products and Categories
    Deleting a product or category will remove them from the app and the admin panel. Please be aware that once you delete a product or category, you won’t be able to undo this action. 

    You can click the ⋮ icon next to any product or category and select delete. 

    Disabling Product and Categories
    If you’d like to temporarily hide any products or categories from the app, you can use the disable feature. This feature can be used for seasonal products or anything else that you don’t want to offer in your app at the moment but might want to offer it in the future. 

    To disable a product or category, click the ⋮ icon next to it and select edit. There’s a disable option that you can turn on or off for both products and categories in the edit mode. 

    Please note that when you disable a category, all the product within that category will also be hidden in the app. You would have to assign those products to different categories if you’d like to offer them through the app.

    Organizing Categories
    Click the ⋮ beside the category that you want to be the first one to appear in the app and select edit. Enter number 1 in the position ordering field. 

    Edit each category in the app the same way and assign a unique number to each category so that they can be sorted based on that number.

    Organizing Products
    You can also organize the products in each category. Click ⋮ icon beside a product and select edit. Click “Advanced Options” under the product image. Type a number in the position ordering field. 

    Continue doing this until all products in the category have a unique number assigned to them under position ordering.

    * The position ordering feature only works when all categories or all products within a category have unique numbers assigned to them. If two or more categories or products have the same position ordering number or there are categories or products that don’t have numbers assigned to them, the app cannot sort them properly.

    Items Page
    There’s now a full page dedicated to all your menu items. We’ve made it easier to navigate and see all the important information about your menu items at a glance. You’ll be able to see the photos and price of each item on this page. The items are separated by their categories.

    We’ve also added two new filters:

    Categories
    Available Location
    The Modifier Options Page
    Modifier Option has its own page now! All your Modifier Options will now appear on this page regardless of the Modifier Group they are attached to. You’ll be able to see which Modifier Groups each Modifier Option is attached to on this new page.

    You can now attach a Modifier Option to multiple Modifier Groups. This makes it easier to manage your Modifier Options. For example, when marking them as out of stock or in stock, you won't need to apply these changes in multiple places.

    We have also added "Bulk Actions" to this page which allows you to change the status of multiple Modifier Options to out of stock and in stock at once. 

    Our new release also features a new design for add/edit Modifier Group and add/edit Modifier Option to provide a better user experience.

    How to Setup Your SpeedLine POS for Craver Integration
    </desc>
    <tutorial>
    In order to receive app orders on your SpeedLine POS, you need to set up access for Craver for each one of your locations with SpeedLine POS. 

    Here are the steps you need to take to create that access for Craver: 

    SpeedLine Store Manager Settings
    In order to enable access for Craver, you will need to make adjustments in your Store Manager. The first step is to create a SpeedLine Connect connection for Craver. You can do that by going to the Settings section and then SpeedLine Connect.

    In there you can add a new connection using the + in the SpeedLine Connect Sources. 

    Once you created the new source, you can fill in the information for Craver connection including setting Name, setting your incoming ticket printing behaviour, etc (as seen in the image below). 

    When the connection information is added, the next step is to create Connection certificates. For this step, you would go to the Connections sub-section, and Generate a local Source Certificate. 

    Once the local Source Certificate is generated, you can Export External Source Certificate by clicking on the Export button, and setting a password for the Certificate. This password needs to be passed to Craver to be used when sending orders to SpeedLine. 

    This process will generate a Certificate file in your SpeedLine Data directory. You will need to send this certificate along with the Password to Craver to set up your integration.

    Another important element here is the Port number. We will use that in the next part of the setup. 

    Setting Up Craver Connection to SpeedLine
    The next part of the setup will take care of the connection line from Craver to SpeedLine. In order for Craver to be able to send orders to SpeedLine, we need to know the dedicated IP address for each location. If you don’t have a dedicated IP address, there are other alternatives such as No-IP by Net Gear available. 

    To find out your IP address, you can go to this website: https://www.whatsmyip.org/

    In addition to an IP address, Craver needs to know the port you have set up in the previous step to be able to connect with SpeedLine. 

    Please send your IP address and Port number to Craver to set up your SpeedLine Connections.

    Firewalls and Port Forwarding
    The connection between Craver and SpeedLine is sometimes impacted by Firewalls and by Port Forwarding issues. Here are what you need to do to avoid these issues:

    For Firewalls, make sure all your Firewalls (local and router level) allow for connection from the specific port you have created for Craver’s Connection. 

    For Port-Forwarding, on your Router, you can program the request to specific ports to be sent to specific addresses in your local network. Please make sure that is set up and the request to the port you set for Craver are sent to the computer with SpeedLine Connect setup.

    1- Request Domain Verification Token
    Email your Craver Account manager and request a Domain Verification Token. Send us your domain name and a verification token will be generated for you. 

    2- Verify Your Domain
    Add the TXT record to the DNS configuration for your domain with the value you receive from your Craver Account Manager. 

    3- Setup your subdomain
    Add the CNAME record to the DNS configuration for your domain with sumdomain.yourdomain.com and the value set to ghs.googlehosted.com

    4- Notify your account manager
    Once CNAME is added, notify your account manager and they will make sure your subdomain is set up for your Craver Web Ordering.
